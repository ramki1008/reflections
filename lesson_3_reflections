Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:When my changes are good to be contributed to the public repository and also as a means of backing up my changes.

Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: To have control over when I should get the changes on to my work area and also ensure that my local work is not overwritten
