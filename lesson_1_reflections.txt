How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
Helped me realise where I could have gone wrong.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?
It will help me track changes better and review for appropriateness.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
I have control of determining when my work should be visible to others.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because often a bug fix or development require editing multiple files together and it is easy to track such changes together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 git log gives the list of check-ins and changes done
 git diff <v1> <v2> give thes diff between two different versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
I always a backup to revert to.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
